#  Courwework 1

## Presentation 
This coursework 1 is a technical prototype and our first Unity Project. 
For the first time we work on a videogame, we came up with the idea of mixing hide-and-seek, puzzle and time travel. 
The main idea of this protoype was to interact with elements in a city in order to hide from an enemy and to progress. 
The win condition is to escape and to do that, you have to join a very crowded street to hide between the NPCs. 
Every element that you can move to hide, you can also rewind, and that's the main mechanic of our coursework that we want to showcase.
In a full game prototype we would love to implement more puzzles with the time travel mechanic, but for now its only purpose is to hide from the enemy.
We added crowd interactions, rigidbody physics, a win and lose condition, and an AI with an A* pathing as required for the coursework, but we also tried new things like camera movements or 3d modeling.
